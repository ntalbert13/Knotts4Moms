          <strong>Knotts Berry Farm transforms Knotts Merry Farm into a Winter Wonderland! </strong> From Nov 22 thru Jan 5th. Knotts Merry Farm has amazing shows, beautiful lights with a snow and light show!! Santas workshop takes place just at the end of GhostTown, it's full of Holiday foods and a meet and greet with the one and only...Santa himself! Though, this is not the only place they have holiday related foods. There are booths around the park, along with food, it's small business vendors!

        <strong>Don't feel like you can't have fun at a theme park with your babies!</strong> My 2 year old daughter and I go to Knotts all the time! She loves snoopy, she claps and yells "whooo!" at the rollercoasters even outside the park! Though she won't remember, we still have so much fun! She's able to go on multiple rides in and out of camp snoopy. She's able to go on Calico Mine Ride (you can even wear your little ones on the ride), the Grand Rio Train, Merry go round and about half of the rides inside camp snoopy.
          Knotts has a giant selection of strollers, double or single. They are made of plastic so spill proof, of course plastic isn't comfy if they need a nap. I'd recommend bringing in your own. Knotts isn't extremely difficult to walk through crowds and there are multiple stroller parkings at each ride entrance and exit. 
          There are lockers to the right on GhostRider, if you need to put your items and merchandise somewhere safe. They range in sizes but do provide XL sizes, probably about cooler sized.

        <strong>Water Rides and Soak City Fun! </strong> While Soak City is next door, There are multiple rides at knotts to stay cool! So grab a boysenberry punch and lets take a walk to Calico River Rapids. A "White-water rafting experience" has undergone a huge renovation with a realistic scenery of wildlife. Sudden splashes and turns is so exciting and the coldness of the water just helps on a hot day! Logride is our next ride and the only big splash you get is at the end of the ride but it is well worth it! Calico Mine Ride is a A/C and cool ride to go on with the whole family to try to beat the heat for a bit!
